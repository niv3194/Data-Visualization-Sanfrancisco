Gender-Wage Gap -Sanfrancisco

This project mainly focuses on the data analysis and pre-processing of the GenderWage gap for the city of San Francisco over a span of 4 years (2011-2014) which is based on
a number of parameters on incomes such as Base Pay, Overtime Pay, Benefits, Total Pay &
Benefits, Other Pay and also contains various job titles along with the employee names. At
the end of this analysis, we would have obtained a clear picture of the income distribution
based on gender as well as various job categories of the people of San Francisco.
